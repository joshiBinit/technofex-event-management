# Search Component Changes

## Previous Implementation

### Search Component
- Basic input field with no styling consistent with Material Design
- No debouncing for search input
- Simple event emission on input change

### Event List Component
- Had a separate filter input in the event list component
- Search component was not properly connected (binding issue)
- Used `events` array instead of `allEvents` for filtering
- Did not update pagination after search

## New Implementation

### Search Component
- Added debouncing (300ms) to prevent excessive filtering on each keystroke
- Updated UI to use Material Design components (mat-form-field, mat-input, mat-icon)
- Improved placeholder text to indicate searchable fields

### Event List Component
- Properly connected search component's output to `onSearchChanged` method
- Removed redundant filter input field
- Updated `onSearchChanged` method to:
  - Use `allEvents` as the source for filtering
  - Add null safety with optional chaining
  - Reset pagination to first page when search changes
  - Update total items count
  - Call `updateDisplayedEvents()` to refresh the displayed data
- Fixed HTML structure for better layout

## Benefits
- More responsive UI with debouncing
- Consistent Material Design styling
- Better user experience with proper pagination after search
- Eliminated duplicate search/filter functionality
- Improved code organization with proper component communication
